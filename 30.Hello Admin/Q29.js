// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
var userNames = ["Sadaf", "Aqsa", "Asharib", "Admin", "Ubaid"];
// Using forEach loop on array
userNames.forEach(function (oneUser) {
    if (oneUser === "Admin") {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(oneUser, ", would you like to see a status report?"));
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(oneUser, ", thank you logging in again."));
    }
});
