// Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

// Creating a array
let pizza = ["Chicken Tikka", "Malai Cheese", "Fajita"]

// Using for loop
for (let onePizza of pizza){
    console.log(`I like ${onePizza} pizza`);
}

// Print a meesage outside of the for loop
console.log("Pizza is love")
