//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Print the message of list
console.log("List of programming languages:")

// Print the values of array in the form of list
programmingLanguages.forEach(language => console.log(language));
